# stickland
A (somewhat) simple MMO in OWOT.

If you want to use this, please note that new stickmans will only appear on 512, -1, 0, 5. 
If you want them to appear somewhere else, you're gonna have to edit the code yourself ~~(because I'm lazy)~~.

Besides that, all you have to do is put a JS link that runs the script somewhere in your world, and you're all set. No need to do anything else. Well, except the map, but that's your problem, not mine.
